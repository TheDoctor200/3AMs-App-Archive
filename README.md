## Note

To all customers who bought these apps, here are the downloads for both ZTwitch and ATube in the latest release section. Please give this a star to get more attention. A maintainer is needed for the apps.

**Important:** Microsoft will **never** refund this, so you are in a fraud, losing money. I tried everything I could to get my money back, including sending screenshots, but it was impossible. I am very upset, which is why I made this page. I still hope to get my money back.
